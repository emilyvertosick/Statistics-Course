## Setting Up

### Software Installation

**R**

Install a pre-compiled binary of R for your OS from here by clicking on "Download R for [your operating system]":
https://cloud.r-project.org

**RStudio**

Install RStudio Desktop by selecting the installer for your operating system under "Desktop Version":

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/

### Setting up course files

To access this course, download the "Statistics Course.zip" file [here](https://github.mskcc.org/vertosie/Statistics-Course/blob/master/Statistics%20Course.zip?raw=true). Create and name a folder (e.g. "MSKCC biostats course") on your hard drive, and then unzip the file and save it in that folder. Open the "Statistics Course" folder and click to open the R project file called "Statistics Course.Rproj". Opening this file will open RStudio (once you have it installed), and you can easily access all files from the "files" tab in the bottom right panel in RStudio.

There is a "Data" folder with 7 subfolders inside, which contain the data files needed for the examples and assignments for weeks 1-7.

There is a "Code" folder with 7 files inside, which contains all the code shown in each weekly lesson, so that you can easily run it yourself without copying and pasting from the book. There is also an "Answers" file which contains the code from the assignment answers.

Every time you work on this course, you should open RStudio by opening the "Statistics Course.Rproj" file. It may be helpful to create a desktop link to the "Statistics Course.Rproj" file so you can easily access the course materials.

### Using RStudio

When you open the "Statistics Course.Rproj" file, RStudio will open, and you will see four panes in the RStudio window.

1. The "console" window at the bottom left is where results will be shown if running R code from a .R file or interactively. The console window is also where you type in instructions for R. To run code in the console window, you can type or copy and paste the code and press "enter."

2. The "source" window in the top left is where you will write out R code for your final .R analysis file. To run code from the source window, highlight the lines of code you'd like to run and click the "run" button, located in the upper right corner of the source window, or use the shortcut "ctrl+enter" on your keyboard.

3. The top right panel includes several tabs. The most important tabs here are "environment", which shows your current datasets and objects, and "history", which shows previous commands that have been run from either the "console" or the "source" window.

4. The bottom right panel also includes several tabs. The "files" tab shows all files in your current directory. The "plots" tab is where plots will be shown if a plot is created. The "packages" tab shows all R packages that are available on your machine. The "help" tab will show help files, and help files can be searched from this tab. The "viewer" tab will show any other files that are created, for example, formatted tables.

### Installing packages

For this course, you will need to install several packages which will allow you to use the set of functions included in that package. To install the necessary packages, copy and paste each line of code below into the console window, and hit enter. If you get the following popup message, please click "yes".

![ ](Images/rinstallmsg.png)

Enter one line at a time, and wait for the packages to install before entering the next line. While the package is installing, you will see a red stop sign icon at the top right corner of the "console" window. Once the stop sign icon disappears, the package installation is complete and you can install the next package. You will only have to install the packages one time.

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, purl = TRUE}

# Installing packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("gt")
install.packages("here")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("epiR")
install.packages("broom")
install.packages("pROC")
install.packages("survival")
install.packages("survminer")
install.packages("remotes")

```

To install the `gt` package, copy the code below into the console window and press enter:

```{r install2, eval = FALSE}

remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")

```

If you are using a Windows computer and get an error message that states <span style="color:red">Error: Could not find tools necessary to compile a package</span>, you will need to download and install the Rtools program before proceeding. The instructions are below:

1. Download the "recommended" version of Rtools (in green) from [this site](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/).
2. Open the "Rtools##.exe" file and follow the installation instructions.
3. After installation is complete, close RStudio and re-open by clicking on the "Statistics Course.RProj" file.
4. Re-run the above code in the console to install the `gt` package.

We will also be installing a package called `gtsummary` written by Dan Sjoberg, a statistician at MSKCC, which can format the results from your R code into a clean, publication-ready table. These tables can be copied and pasted from R into a Word document as well. The code below will install this package.

```{r install3, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, purl = TRUE}

install.packages("gtsummary")

```

### A Note About Packages

There are hundreds of R packages available, and often there are many packages available to perform the same analyses. The packages you will use in this course have been chosen because they make coding easier, perform the necessary analyses and/or create nicely formatted output such as tables and graphs. You may work with statisticians who use different packages to perform these same analyses or to format tables and graphs. For all packages except the `gt` package, if you give the package name to your statistician, they will be able to find and install the packages directly using the `install.packages` function as we have done above. If you'd like to share the `gt` package, [this link](https://github.com/rstudio/gt) gives more detailed information on the functionality of the package as well as how to access and download the package.

## R Instructions

### Opening a data file created by someone else

This is mainly what you will be doing during this course. You will be loading data from files with a ".rds" extension, which is a type of file that can be exported from R. There are two ways to do this:

1. You can load files by typing or copying the following code into the console window and pressing enter. Each lesson will have code in the "Setting Up" section that will load all data necessary to run the examples in the lesson. You can copy and paste that code into your console window and press "enter" to load the files. In the "Assignments" section, there will also be code to load the files necessary for the assignment.

```{r loaddata, eval = TRUE, purl = TRUE}

# You can copy and paste this code into the console window and press "enter"
# to load the data needed for the week 1 examples
lesson1a <- readRDS(here::here("Data", "Week 1", "lesson1a.rds"))

```

2. Using the "files" tab on the bottom righthand side of the RStudio window. Click on the "files" tab, and navigate to the folder where the data is stored, for example, by clicking on the "Data" folder. Click on the desired data ".rds" file. A "Load R Object" popup will appear, which allows you to change the name of the dataset when you import it. It is fine for this course to leave the dataset names as is. Clicking "OK" will load this file to your environment, which you can confirm by looking for the dataset in the top right "environment" tab.

![ ](images\load_data.jpg)
<br>

### Loading packages

The packages you have installed contain a number of functions. There are two ways to use the functions from these packages: by loading the package, or specifying the package name every time you use a function from that package.

If you attempt to use a function from a package without loading that package or specifying the package name, you will get an error.

As an example, the `skim` function comes from the `skimr` package. Using `skim` without loading or specifying the `skimr` package will give an error:

```{r loadpkgs1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, error = TRUE}

# This will give an error - the "skimr" package isn't loaded yet
skim(lesson1a$age)

```

You can give both the package name and function name to avoid this error:

```{r loadpkgs2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}

# You can use the function "skim" by specifying package "skimr"
skimr::skim(lesson1a$age)

```

However, for commonly used packages, it is easier to load the whole package so you do not need to type out the package name every time you use a function. Packages are loaded by typing the package name into the `library` function. While you only need to install the packages once, you will need to load any packages you want to use every time you open up the "Statistics Course.Rproj" file in RStudio. For example, to load the `skimr` package, type or copy and paste the following line of code into the console window, and press enter.

```{r loadpkgs3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(skimr)

```

Now you will be able to use all functions in the `skimr` package without specifying the package name each time. Below is R code that will load all the packages you will need to use in this course. You can copy and paste these lines into your console window every time you start working in RStudio. This code will also be available at the beginning of each lesson.

```{r loadpkgs4, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Here is the code to load all necessary packages
library(skimr)
library(gt)
library(gtsummary)
library(epiR)
library(broom)
library(pROC)
library(gmodels)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(tidyverse)

```

### Looking at the data

R stores the data in the form of a spreadsheet. The rows are individual observations, normally a patient. The columns are variables giving data for that observation. View the dataset "lesson1a" by typing the following into the console window and hitting enter (a new window will pop up):

```{r section1a, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, results = "hide"}

# View the data as a spreadsheet
View(lesson1a)

```

This is data from 386 patients undergoing surgery. You can see the patient’s hospital code number as the variable "id" and then their age and sex. There are then lists of other variables with names such as "p1", "t", "x" and so on. You can see that you can have both numbers and text as a variable. You may also notice that some variables have a value of "NA" for a particular observation. In R, "NA" indicates missing data. 

### Typing a command

There are two options to run R code: you can type or copy and paste code into either the "console" window or the "source" window. To run code from the "console" window, simply press "enter". To run code from the "source" window, highlight the code you would like to run, and click the "run" button (top right corner of the "source" window) or use the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+enter".

A typical command is of the form: `packagename::function(options)`. If a package has already been loaded using the `library` function (as we did above), you can omit `packagename::` when running the code.

Since you can have multiple datasets in R at the same time, your command must indicate which dataset you are referring to. This is usually done by including the dataset name inside the parentheses of the function.

For example, this will summarize the data for the full `lesson1a` dataset.

```{r section1b_1, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, results = "hide"}

# View a summary of the dataset
skim(lesson1a)

```

The output above this text is the code, and the output below this shows the results produced by running that code. (We will discuss the results output in more detail later.)

```{r section1b_2, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, purl = FALSE}

skim(lesson1a)

```

### Some Useful Commands

#### Extracting a variable by name ($)

To refer to one variable in your dataset, you can use the notation `dataset$variable` to indicate which dataset you are referencing, and which variable within that dataset.

For example, this will summarize just the variable `age` from the `lesson1a` dataset.

```{r section1c}

# View a summary of the "age" variable only
skim(lesson1a$age)

```

#### Pipe operator (%>%)

One of the most useful commands is known as the pipe operator (%>%). The pipe operator can be read as "and then". Pipes allow a dataset to be passed from the left side of the pipe to the command on the right side. The dataset you are using will be referenced on the left side of the pipe, rather than included as an option in the next function. This notation is useful because it can make your code more clear if you are using more than one function.

For example, if you were using three functions called `function1`, `function2` and `function3`, you could write this code in two ways:

1. `function3(function2(function1(lesson1a)))`

or

2. `lesson1a %>% function1() %>% function2() %>% function3()`

Here is an example of piping using the `skim` function:

This piece of code can be read as, "Use the `skim` function on the lesson1a dataset".

```{r section1d_1, eval = TRUE, results = "hide"}

# You can put the dataset into the function
skim(lesson1a)

```

This piece of code can be read as, "Take the lesson1a dataset, **and then** give this data to the `skim` function to use."

```{r section1d_2, eval = TRUE, results = "hide"}

# You can also use the "pipe" operator
lesson1a %>% skim()

```

You can see that both of these lines of code are doing the same thing, although the order of the function and the dataset are different. Both will give the same results - try copying both lines of code into your console window to check that this is true.

```{r section1d_3, eval = TRUE, results = "hide"}

# These two pieces of code will also give the same results
skim(lesson1a$age)
lesson1a %>% skim(age)

```

#### `head` function

The `head` function allows you to see the first few rows of your dataset in the console window, including the variable names and variable types at the top of the table. (Using the code `head(lesson1a)` will also give you the same results.)

```{r section1e}

# Look at the first few rows of your data
lesson1a %>% head()

```

#### `table` function

The `table` function is the basic function for creating one-way and two-way tables. However, these tables often do not provide much information and are not formatted nicely or in a way that can easily be copied to a Word document.

Here is an example:

```{r section1e1}

# Note: the "trial" dataset is automatically loaded when you load your packages
# and does not have to be manually loaded like the "lesson1a" dataset

# Create two-way table for response and death
table(trial$response, trial$death)

```

If you are not familiar with R code or with your data, this table is not very useful. There is nothing to indicate which variable is represented by the columns, and which variable is represented by the rows. The table only provides counts, and does not provide any percents.

If you print the "response" variable, you can also see that there are "NA" values in the response variable, which the table doesn't include at all.

```{r section1e2}

# Print response variable values
trial$response

```

#### `tbl_summary` function

The `tbl_summary` function (from the `gtsummary` package) creates and formats tables so that it is clear what the columns and rows are, and also includes any missing values. This function also formats the tables in a way that can easily be copied and pasted into a Word document for publication.

In this course, we will be using the `tbl_summary` function instead of the `table` function for all tables that will be displayed. There are some cases where the `table` function will be used in conjunction with another function to perform an analysis, but these tables will not be displayed.

The `tbl_summary` function can create one-way and two-way tables for binary and categorical variables. It can also create tables which include summary statistics for continuous variables (by default, median and quartiles). The `select` function allows you to list the variables you would like to include in your table. Here, we are only showing sex in the table.

```{r section1f}

# Create a formatted table for the "sex" variable
tbl_summary(
  lesson1a %>% select(sex) 
)

```

As you can see, there is currently only one row in the table. If a variable has values of 0 and 1 only, the `tbl_summary` function gives the percentage of values that are equal to 1 by default. If you would like to see the percentage of both 0 and 1 values, you can use the "type" option and specify that the variable is categorical.

```{r section1g}

# Create a formatted table for the "sex" variable, showing both "0" and "1" values
tbl_summary(
  lesson1a %>% select(sex),
  type = list("sex" ~ "categorical")
)

```

<br>

This tells you that the "sex" variable has no missing data because the table only shows values of "0" and "1", with no "NA" values. It also shows that there only 2 different values, all of which are integers (i.e. whole numbers). Now this is useful because if you had been sent a set of data for sex and the `tbl_summary` function told you that there were 4 unique values, some of which were not integers, you would want to check the data further before doing any analysis.

Since 0 = man and 1 = woman based on the variable label (see the first row of the table), this means that there were `r inline_text(tbl_summary(lesson1a %>% select(sex), type = list("sex" ~ "categorical"), statistic = list("sex" ~ "{n}")), variable = "sex", level = "0")` men in the `r nrow(lesson1a)` patients and that they constituted `r inline_text(tbl_summary(lesson1a %>% select(sex), type = list("sex" ~ "categorical"), statistic = list("sex" ~ "{p}%")), variable = "sex", level = "0")` of the population.

The `tbl_summary` function can also be used for two-way tables. The `select` function is used to select both variables of interest, and the name of the column variable is specified in the `by` statement. As you can see, this table is much clearer, as well as nicer looking, than the table created by the `table` function.

```{r section1h}

# Create two-way table for response and death using "table" function
table(trial$response, trial$death)

# Create two-way table for response and death using "tbl_summary" function
tbl_summary(
  trial %>% select(response, death),
  by = death,
  type = list("response" ~ "categorical")
)

```

#### `skim` function

The `skim` function (from the `skimr` package) gives basic summary data.

```{r section1i}

# Show summary statistics for "age"
skim(lesson1a$age)

```

So of the `r nrow(lesson1a)` patients (column "n"), the mean age (a type of average, I’ll explain next week) is `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[4]]` (column "mean"), the standard deviation (again, I’ll explain next week) is `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[5]]` (column "sd"). The youngest patient was `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[6]]` (column "p0") and the oldest is `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[10]]` (column "p100"). 

This simple command gives us our first lesson about the dangers of statistical software: it gives the age to within a few minutes. So if you were reporting results for a journal, you would never say that mean age was `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[4]]`, you’d probably just say `r round(skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[4]], 0)`.

"p0" here represents the minimum age in the dataset - `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[6]]`. "p100" represents the maximum age of `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[10]]`. "p25", "p50" and "p75" are the centiles. We'll talk more about this later, but briefly, "p25 = 40" means that 25% of the patients were aged 40 and younger. The number by "p50" (i.e. `r skim(lesson1a$age)$value[[8]]`) is the median.

#### `mutate` function

The `mutate` function is used to create new variables, or replace variable values.

The code below means: create a new variable called "a" and set it equal to 1 in all observations. The "<-" indicator means to then save out this new dataset including the "a" variable as "lesson1a", replacing the old "lesson1a" dataset that does not include "a".

```{r section1j}

# Save the data out as "lesson1a"
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>% # Take the current "lesson1a" dataset
  mutate(a = 1) # And add a variable called "a" with a value of "1"

```

Since we have already created the variable "a" above, the code below means: replace the variable "a" with the value of 2 in all observations.

```{r section1k}

# Replace the value of "a" with "2" for all observations
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>%
  mutate(a = 2)

```

You can also replace one variable with the value of another variable. The code below means: replace the variable "a" with whatever the value of "p1" is in each observation.

```{r section1l}

# Replace the value of "a" with the value of "p1" for all observations
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>%
  mutate(a = p1)

```

You can also calculate values inside a `mutate` statement. For example, you can create an average of the four variables "p1" - "p4".

```{r section1m}

# Replace "a" with the average of "p1", "p2", "p3" and "p4"
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>%
  mutate(a = (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4)/4)

```

#### `if_else` function

The `if_else` function can be used with the `mutate` function to assign values to a variable based on a specific condition.

The first argument in the `if_else` function is the "if" condition. The second argument is the value of the variable for observations that meet the "if" condition. The third argument is the value of the variable for observations that do not meet the "if" condition.

For example, the code below says: replace the value of "a" with "p1" if "p1" is greater than 4. Otherwise, keep the original value "a".

```{r section1n}

# Replace the value of "a" with "p1" if the value of "p1" is greater than 4
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>%
  mutate(a = if_else(p1 > 4, p1, a))

```

In this case, we are only replacing for females. Note that when you use equals sign after an "if" you have to use two of them in a row to signify "is equal to" rather than "make equal to".

```{r section1o}

# Replace the value of "a" with "p1" if "sex" equals 1 (female)
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>%
  mutate(a = if_else(sex == 1, p1, a))

```

The `|` sign means "or", such that the code below means: set "a" equal to 1 if "y" is equal to either "campus" or "peds". Otherwise, keep the original value of "a".

```{r section1p}

# Replace the value of "a" with "1" if "y" is equal to either "campus" or "peds"
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>%
  mutate(a = if_else(y == "campus" | y == "peds", 1, a))

```

You can give check for more than one condition by using the "&" sign. This code looks for observations where the patient is female (sex == 1) and the patient is older than 50 (age > 50). This creates a subgroup of older women: "a" is 1 for older women and 0 for everybody else.

```{r section1q}

# Replace the value of "a" with 1 if sex equals 1 (female) and age > 50
# For all other observations, replace "a" with 0
lesson1a <-
  lesson1a %>%
  mutate(a = if_else(sex == 1 & age > 50, 1, 0))

```

### Using Help

There is a good help feature where you can learn more about functions (though not about statistics...). You can access the help files by typing `?packagename::functionname` or `?functionname` into the console, for example `?mutate`.

TODO: Discuss with Andrew re: taking following section out
However, BE CAREFUL. It is very easy to get lost in the multitude of different functions. I strongly suggest you don't start using the help function until the end of the course. There is absolutely no reason to use help during the course because there will be examples including all commands you need.

## Assignments

```{r assignmentdata, eval = TRUE, purl = TRUE}

# Copy and paste this code to load the data for week 1 assignments
lesson1a <- readRDS(here::here("Data", "Week 1", "lesson1a.rds"))

```

The data for you to look at are in the attached file lesson1a.rds.

This is data for 386 patients undergoing surgery. What type of data (e.g. continuous, binary, ordinal, nonsense) are each of the variables?
